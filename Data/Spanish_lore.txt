#$ 1The Story So Far
1La Historia Hasta Ahora
#$ 1You are Captain Kayto Shields, the former captain of the assault carrier Sunrider. You hail from the Neutral Rim World of Cera, which was brutally conquered by PACT seven years ago. Since then, you have fought a one ship war against PACT, and gathered allies across the galaxy to liberate your home world.\n\nYour heroic deeds appeared to have paid off, and with the aid of the Solar Alliance, you liberated Cera from the PACT fleet. Unfortunately, your girlfriend, Chigara Ashada, turned out to be a Prototype sleeper agent, who betrayed you at the celebration ceremony to assassinate Admiral Grey of the Solar Alliance. This event, called the Liberation Day Massacre, only escalated the war between the Solar Alliance and PACT, and led to the destruction of the Sunrider.\n\nNow assumed dead, you live in exile in the dusty mining world of Tydaria, a shell of your former self...
1Eres el Capitán Kayto Shields, el antiguo capitán del carguero de asalto Sunrider. Provienes del Mundo Cera del Margen Neutral, el cual fue brutalmente conquistado por el PACT hace siete años. Desde entonces, has luchado una guerra con una sola nave contra el PACT, y reunido aliados por la galaxia para liberar tu mundo hogar.\n\nTus actos heróicos parecían haber dado frutos, y con la ayuda de la Alianza Solar, liberaste Cera de la flota del PACT. Desafortunadamente, tu novia, Chigara Ashada, demostró ser un agente durmiente Prototipo, quien te traicionó en la ceremonia de celebración para asesinar al Almirante Grey de la Alianza Solar. Este evento, llamado la Masacre del Día de Liberación, solo intensificó la guerra entre la Alianza Solar y el PACT, y llevó a la destrucción del Sunrider.\n\nAhora asumido como muerto, vives en el exilio en el polvoriento mundo minero de Tydaria, como una cáscara de tu antiguo yo...
#$ 4Assault Carrier

#$ 2Neutral Rim
2El Margen Neutral
#$ 2A large expanse of space encompassing hundreds of inhabited worlds which separates the Solar Alliance from PACT. Following the Alliance-Imperial War, the Treaty of Vespa was signed, which created a buffer zone between the two powers from the former core worlds of the Holy Ryuvian Empire. However, these supposedly neutral worlds fell prey to PACT's growing ambitions.
2Una gran parcela de espacio abarcando cientos de mundos deshabitados que separan a la Alianza Solar del PACT. Tras la Guerra Alianza-Imperial, el Tratado de Vespa fue firmado, el cual creaba una zona intermediaria entre ambos poderes a partir de los antiguos mundos interiores del Sagrado Imperio Ryuviano. Sin embargo, estos supuestamente mundos neutrales cayeron presas de las crecientes ambiciones del PACT.
#$ 2The People's Alliance (PACT)
2La Alianza de los Pueblos (PACT)
#$ 2PACT, or the People's Alliance, is a totalitarian and communistic state formed in rebellion against the New Empire. Under the leadership of Veniczar Arcadius, PACT undertook an expansionistic policy and invaded the Neutral Rim Territories to ostensibly liberate those worlds from Solaris influence. However, it turned out that the Prototype Alice had merely impersonated the deceased Arcadius to exact her revenge against humanity. Following Alice's defeat in the Battle of Cera, PACT has been under the leadership of Veniczar Fontana, a moderate, who seeks to restore stability to the Neutral Rim Territories.
2PACT, o la Alianza de los Pueblos, es un estado comunista y totalitario formado en la rebelión contra el Nuevo Imperio. Bajo el liderazgo de Veniczar Arcadius, el PACT tomó una política expansionista e invadió los Territorios del Margen Neutral para supuestamente liberar a esos mundos de la influencia de Solaris. Sin embargo, terminó siendo que el Prototipo Alice había simplemente suplantado al fallecido Arcadius para ejercer su venganza contra la humanidad. Tras la derrota de Alice en la Batalla de Cera, el PACT ha estado bajo el liderazgo de Veniczar Fontana, un moderado, que busca restaurar la estabilidad a los Territorios del Margen Neutral.
#$ 2The Solar Alliance (The Alliance)
2La Alianza Solar (La Alianza)
#$ 2An alliance of over a hundred worlds, led by the wealthy planet of Solaris. The Solar Alliance was founded by wealthy merchant corporations in a rebellion against the imperialism of the New Empire. The Solar Alliance is the beacon of free enterprise in the galaxy. Following PACT's invasion of the Neutral Rim, the Solar Alliance backed you and liberated countless Neutral Rim worlds from PACT. However, with each world they liberated from PACT, they also expanded their military occupation of the Neutral Rim, allegedly to protect the safety of its inhabitants.
2Una alianza de más de cien mundos, liderados por el rico planeta de Solaris. La Alianza Solar fue fundada por ricas corporaciones de mercaderes en una rebelion contra el imperialismo del Nuevo Imperio. La Alianza Solar es un faro de libres aventuras en la galaxia. Luego de la invasión del PACT al Margen Neutral, la Alianza Solar te respaldó y liberó incontables mundos del Margen Neutral del PACT. Sin embargo, con cada mundo que liberaban del PACT, también expandían su ocupación militar en el Margen Neutral, alegando proteger la seguridad de sus habitantes.
#$ 1Admiral Harold Grey
1Almirante Harold Grey
#$ 1The admiral of the Solar Alliance Combined Fleet, and the architect of the Neutral Rim War. For the better or worse, he liberated the Neutral Rim from PACT and established the Solar Alliance's brand of democracy via military occupation. He was assassinated by Chigara Ashada in the Liberation Day Massacre, dealing a crippling blow to the Solar Alliance's military might.

Para bien o para mal, liberó al Margen Neutral del PACT y estableció la marca de la Alianza Solar de la democracia a través de una ocupación militar. Fue asesinado por Chigara Ashada en la Masacre del Día de Liberación, asestándole un duro golpe al poder militar de la Alianza Solar.
#$ 2The New Empire
2El Nuevo Imperio
#$ 2The New Empire ruled over the galaxy for over 500 years following the collapse of the Holy Ryuvian Empire, largely continuing the traditions of the Ryuvians, despite the relocation of the capital from Ryuvia Prime to New Eden. The New Empire was an aristocratic monarchy, where the nobility ruled over the peasantry merely via the virtue of their birth. A communist revolution movement, called Compact, eventually toppled the monarchy, and established a new government, the People's Alliance (PACT). However, the revolution proved to be bloody, and the madwoman Alice Ashada impersonated Veniczar Arcadius following his death to lead PACT into an invasion of the Neutral Rim Territories.
2El Nuevo Imperio gobernó la galaxia durante más de 500 años luego del colapso del Sagrado Imperio Ryuviano, continuando en su mayoría las tradiciones de los Ryuvianos, a pesar de la recolocación de la capital desde Ryuvia Prime hacia New Eden. El Nuevo Imperio fue una monarquía aristocrática, donde la nobleza gobernaba sobre los campesinos meramente por la virtud de su nacimiento. Un movimiento revolucionario comunista, llamado Compact, eventualmente derrocó a la monarquía, y estableció un nuevo gobierno, la Alianza de los Pueblos (PACT). A pesar de eso, la revolución demostró ser sangrienta, y la demente Alice Ashada suplantó a Veniczar Arcadius tras su muerte para liderar al PACT a una invasión de los territorios del Margen Neutral.
#$ 2The Holy Ryuvian Empire
2El Sagrado Imperio Ryuviano
#$ 2An ancient and all-powerful civilization from which all of modern technology derives. The Holy Ryuvian Empire ruled the galaxy for countless millennia under an iron fist, as the nobility monopolized the empire's powerful technology to rule over the masses. However, the royal court eventually succumbed to corruption and internal strife. Over-extended beyond its capacity, the Ryuvian Empire collapsed, and power transferred from Ryuvia Prime to New Eden, which continued Ryuvia's traditions.
2Una antigua y todopoderosa civilización de la cual todos los dispositivos tecnológicos derivan. El Sagrado Imperio Ryuviano gobernó la galaxia durante incontables milenios bajo un puño de hierro, ya que la nobleza monopolizaba la poderosa tecnología del imperio para gobernar sobre las masas. Sin embargo, la corte real eventualmente sucumbió a la corrupción y al conflicto interno. Extendido más allá de su capacidad, el Imperio Ryuviano colapsó, y el poder fue transferido de Ryuvia Prime a New Eden, el cual continuó las tradiciones de Ryuvia.
#$ 1The Prototypes/Alice Ashada
1Los Prototipos/Alice Ashada
#$ 1A genetically modified race of super humans who were created by a secretive order of scientists on the remote world of Diode. The Diodians sought to create a new race who would lead humanity to a new age of scientific advancement. The Prototype and the Alpha were born from their research, two super humans born with intellectual capabilities far beyond our own. However, the Prototype murdered the scientists and became a Compact rebel known as Alice Ashada. She was corrupted by the bloodshed of the Compact Revolution and eventually became a nihilist who took control of PACT with the sole aim of destroying all of humanity.
1Una raza genéticamente modificada de super humanos que fueron creados por una secta secreta de científicos en el remoto mundo de Diode. Los Diodanos buscaban crear una nueva raza que lideraría a la humanidad a una nueva era de avances científicos. El Prototipo y el Alpha nacieron de su investigación, dos super humanos nacidos con capacidades intelectuales más allá de la nuestra propia. Sin embargo, el Prototipo asesinó a los científicos y se volvió una rebelde de Compact conocida como Alice Ashada. Se corrompió por la matanza de la Revolución Compact y eventualmente una nihilista que tomó el control del PACT con el único objetivo de destruir a toda la humanidad.
# 1Chigara Ashada
1Chigara Ashada
#$ 1A Prototype sleeper agent created by the Alpha to spy on Princess Asaga di Ryuvia. She became your girlfriend during the events of the Neutral Rim War. However, when you liberated Cera from PACT, her sleeper agent protocol activated, and she assassinated Admiral Grey, fulfilling Alice's insane plan to spark an intergalactic war between PACT and the Solar Alliance. However, it seems that she now fights against Alice in the mindstream, and was responsible for convincing the Prototype Lynn to save you from the doomed Sunrider.
1Un agente durmiente Prototipo creado por el Alpha para espiar a la Princesa Asaga di Ryuvia. Se volvió tu novia durante los eventos de la Guerra del Margen Neutral. Sin embargo, cuando liberaste a Cera del PACT, su protocolo de agente durmiente se activó, y asesinó al Almirante Grey, completando el demente plan de Alice para iniciar una guerra intergaláctica entre el PACT y la Alianza Solar. Aun así, parece que ahora lucha contra Alice en el torrente de mentes, y fue la responsable de convencer al Prototipo Lynn de salvarte del condenado Sunrider.

#$ 3The Liberation Day Massacre
3La Masacre del Día de Liberación
#$ 3What was supposed to be a celebration of the Solar Alliance's victory in the Battle of Cera instead became a tragedy which sparked six additional years of war between the Alliance and PACT. As Chigara Ashada, the chief engineer of the Sunrider, was awarded the Fereldan Cross for her instrumental role in saving the Alliance Fleet, her sleeper agent protocol activated and she shot Admiral Grey dead. You managed to release her from the Prototypes' control, but Fontana, believing Chigara to be a Prototype agent, killed her. As Chigara died in your arms, you swore vengeance upon Fontana and PACT for killing your love.
3Lo que se suponía que fuese una celebración por la victoria de la Alianza Solar en la Batalla de Cera se volvió en cambio una tragedia que inició seis años adicionales de guerra entre la Alianza y el PACT. Cuando Chigara Ashada, la ingeniera jefa del Sunrider, fue premiada con el Fereldan Cross por su rol decisivo en salvar a la Flota de la Alianza, su protocolo de agente durmiente se activó y asesinó de un disparo al Almirante Grey. Lograste liberarla del control de los Prototipos, pero Fontana, creyendo que Chigara era un agente Prototipo, la asesinó. Con Chigara muerta en tus brazos, juraste venganza de Fontana y el PACT por matar a tu amor.
# 1Sola 
1Sola 
#$ 1One of the former members of the Sunrider's ryder wing. Sola is an ancient Ryuvian who was mysteriously transported thousands of years into the future to our era. She is the illegitimate daughter of the ancient Emperor Rayvin and was impressed into service in a civil war against the Emperor's half-brother, Crow Harbor. She was baptized Sharr Sola di Ryuvia and became a hero to the Ryuvians. In her final battle with Crow Harbor, she activated the Ryuvian flagship, the Sharr'Lac's Final Tear, which would destroy Crow Harbor's ship at the cost of her own life. However, upon its activation, she found herself transported thousands of years in the future, to a strange, unfamiliar world. Seeking to defend Ryuvia against PACT, she joined your crew, renewing her oath to Queen Asaga. Following the Sunrider's destruction, she has followed you to Tydaria, and has served as your aloof guardian for the past six years.
1Una de las antiguas miembros del escuadrón de ryders del Sunrider. Sola es una antigua Ryuviana que fue misteriosamente transportada miles de años al futuro hasta nuestra era. Ella es la hija ilegítima del antiguo Emperador Rayvin y fue forzada a servir en una guerra civil contra el medio-hermano del Emperador, Crow Harbor. Fue bautizada como Sharr Sola di Ryuvia y se volvió un héroe para los Ryuvianos. En su batalla final contra Crow Harbor, activó la nave insignea Ryuviana, la Final Tear del Sharr'Lac, la cual destruiría la nave de Crow Harbor a costa de su propia vida. Sin embargo, tras su activación, se encontró transportada miles de años en el futuro, a un extraño, y desconocido mundo. Buscando defender a Ryuvia contra el PACT, se unió a tu tripulación, renovando su juramento a la Reina Asaga. Tras la destrucción del Sunrider, te siguió hacia Tydaria, y ha servido como tu apartada guardiana durante los últimos seis años.
# 1Veniczar Fontana
1Veniczar Fontana
#$ 1The current leader of PACT and your sworn enemy. He long suspected that Alice Ashada no longer believed in Arcadius' vision of an egalitarian society and became the leader of a peace faction within PACT who sought to negotiate the end of the war with the Solar Alliance. During the Liberation Day Massacre, he killed Chigara Ashada, believing her to be a servant of Alice and the Prototypes. Following that, he was ensnared in a war against the Alliance which he did not want, but which he dominated. He is now the ruler of the Neutral Rim and believes he can restore peace and fairness to humanity. However, he finds himself becoming more and more of a tyrant to preserve order in a galaxy torn apart by war.
1El actual líder del PACT y tu enemigo jurado. Sospechaba desde hacía mucho tiempo que Alice ya no creía más en la visión de Arcadius de una sociedad igualitaria y se volvió el líder de una facción pacífica dentro del PACT que buscaba negociar el fin de la guerra con la Alianza Solar. Durante la Masacre del Día de Liberación, asesinó a Chigara Ashada, creyendo que era una sirviente de Alice y los Prototipos. Tras eso, fue atrapado en una guerra contra la Alianza que él no quiso, pero la cual dominó. Es ahora el gobernante del Margen Neutral y cree que puede restaurar la paz y la justicia a la humanidad. Sin embargo, se encuentra a sí mismo volviéndose más y más un tirano para preservar el orden en una galaxia desgarrada por la guerra.
#$ 3Ancient History
3Historia Antigua
#$ 3Nobody knows where humans originated from. What is clear is that we became the dominant form of sentient life in the galaxy. We expanded from our birth planet and spread throughout the galaxy. Lifeforms below us were turned into food or fashioned into raw materials for industry. Alien lifeforms hostile to our existence were defeated in what we would call wars and driven to extinction. This happened so long ago that nobody even remembers or knows for sure what strange alien races stood against humanity. All people have are fossils in museums indicating some kind of human-alien war took place, millions upon millions of years ago.
3Nadie sabe dónde se originaron los humanos. Lo que está claro es que nos volvimos la forma de vida inteligente dominante en la galaxia. Nos expandimos desde nuestro planeta de nacimiento y nos esparcimos a través de la galaxia. Las formas de vida bajo nosotros fueron convertidas en comida o transformadas en materia prima para la industria. Las formas de vida alienígenas hostiles a nuestra existencia fueron derrotadas en lo que llamaríamos guerras y conducidas a la extinción. Esto sucedió hace tanto tiempo que nadie siquiera recuerda o conoce con seguridad qué extrañas razas alienígenas se enfrentaron a la humanidad. Todo lo que la gente tiene son fósiles en museos indicando algún tipo de guerra humano-alien que tuvo lugar, millones y millones de años atrás.
#$ 3The Era of the Holy Ryuvian Empire
3La Era del Sagrado Imperio Ryuviano
#$ 3All of humanity's greatest technological accomplishments come from the Holy Ryuvian Empire, which conquered all other human nations a million years ago and became the galactic hegemon. The Church of Ryuvia established the Ryuvian Emperor as the god of humanity. From Ryuvia Prime, the Emperor ruled humanity like a terrible tyrant, using the near magical technology of Ryuvia for himself.>>>>Amongst the Ryuvian technologies was the Ryder. It is a humanoid mecha of formidable combat prowess. The Ryder was used both for ceremonial purpose and as a vehicle of war by Ryuvia.>>>>During Ryuvia's million year rule of humanity, the legend of the Sharr was established. The Sharr was the moral symbol of the Ryuvian Empire. She was submissive to the Emperor, but a powerful warrior; beautiful, but virginal; frail, but invincible; beloved by the people, but detached from the masses. Most importantly, the Sharr was the greatest Ryder pilot of the Ryuvian Empire. She was the embodiment of the warrior ideal, and girls across the galaxy dreamed of becoming the Sharr. To this very day, many ryder pilots are female, due to the Ryuvian Empire's lasting cultural influence.
3Todos los mayores logros tecnológicos de la humanidad vienen del Sagrado Imperio Ryuviano, el cual conquistó todas las otras naciones hace un millón de años y se volvió la hegemonía galáctica. La Iglesia de Ryuvia estableció al Emperador Ryuviano como el dios de la humanidad. Desde Ryuvia Prime, el Emperador gobernaba a la humanidad como un terrible tirano, usando las casi mágicas tecnologías de Ryuvia para sí mismo.>>>>Entre las tecnologías Ryuvianas estaba el Ryder. Es un mecha humanoide de un formidable poder de combate. El Ryder era usado tanto para propósitos ceremoniales y como un vehículo de guerra por Ryuvia.>>>>Durante el millón de años que Ryuvia gobernó la humanidad, la leyenda de la Sharr fue establecida. La Sharr era el símbolo moral del Emperador Ryuviano. Era sumisa al Emperador, pero una poderosa guerrera; bella, pero virginal; frágil, pero invencible; amada por la gente, pero desatada de las masas. Más importante, la Sharr era la mejor piloto Ryder del Imperio Ryuviano. Ella era la personificación del guerrero ideal, y chicas por toda la galaxia soñaban con volverse la Sharr. Hasta este mismo día, muchos de los pilotos ryder son mujeres, debido a la duradera influencia cultural del Imperio Ryuviano.
#$ 3The Fall of the Holy Ryuvian Empire
3La Caída del Sagrado Imperio Ryuviano
#$ 3As the millennia's went on, the Ryuvian Empire became more corrupt. The royal court became a snake pit, where men and women fought for their own personal interests, rather than the good of the nation. The Empire continued on for centuries, but eventually, even the Ryuvians' power decayed. After a string of weak rulers, the Holy Empire collapsed, starting the modern era.
3Mientras pasaban los milenios, el Imperio Ryuviano se volvió más corrupto. La corte real se volvió un pozo de serpientes, donde hombres y mujeres luchaban por sus propios intereses personales, en lugar del bien de la nación. El Imperio continuó durante siglos, pero eventualmente, incluso el poder de los Ryuvianos decayó. Luego de una cadena de débiles gobernantes, el Sagrado Imperio colapsó, comenzando la era moderna.
#$ 3The Rise of the New Empire
3El Surgimiento del Nuevo Imperio
#$ 3With the collapse of the Holy Empire, humanity descended into a brief, but uncertain dark age. However, order was eventually established by the New Empire, a new nation modelled after the Holy Empire, but this time with its capital situated in the planet of New Eden, rather than Ryuvia Prime.>>>>The New Empire continued the traditions of the Ryuvian Church, the Emperor, and the Sharr. However, it was consumed by the same vices of the Holy Empire. The royal court was corrupt, and the division of wealth was unequal between the royals and the commoners.>>>>Meanwhile, now free of the tyranny of the Holy Empire, countless independent worlds formed outside of the New Empire's territory. None of them matched the New Empire's power, but each began to develop their own sense of national identity.
3Con el colapso del Sagrado Imperio, la humanidad descendió a una breve pero incierta era oscura. Sin embargo, el orden fue eventualmente establecido por el Nuevo Imperio, una nueva nación moldeada a semejanza del Sagrado Imperio, pero esta vez con su capital situada en el planeta de New Eden, en lugar de Ryuvia Prime.>>>>El Nuevo Imperio continuó las tradiciones de la Iglesia Ryuviana, el Emperador, y la Sharr. Sin embargo, fue consumido por los mismos vicios del Sagrado Imperio. La corte real estaba corrupta, y la división de las riquezas era desigual entre la realeza y los plebeyos.>>>>Mientras tanto, ahora libres de la tiranía del Sagrado Imperio, incontables mundos independientes se formaron fuera del territorio del Nuevo Imperio. Ninguno de ellos rivalizaba el poder del Nuevo Imperio, pero cada uno comenzó a desarrollar su propio sentido de identidad nacional.
#$ 3The Beginning of PACT
3El Comienzo del PACT
#$ 3The commoners of the New Empire formed a rebel group called Compact against the New Empire. Compact was brutally repressed by the New Empire. The leaders of the rebellion were called the Vennisars. Countless Vennisars were murdered by the New Empire. In the early days of the rebellion, Compact was not a serious threat to the New Empire, and mostly constituted of poorly equipped bandits. The New Empire used Compact as a bogeyman to intimidate the people into supporting the royals, and most people viewed Compact as a group of angry young rioters.
3Los plebeyos del Nuevo Imperio formaron un grupo rebelde llamado Compact contra el Nuevo Imperio. Compact fue brutalmente reprimido por el Nuevo Imperio. Los líderes de la rebelión eran llamados los Vennisars. Incontables Vennisars fueron asesinados por el Nuevo Imperio. En los primeros días de la rebelión, Compact no era una seria amenaza para el Nuevo Imperio, y estaba mayormente constituido por bandidos pobremente equipados. El Nuevo Imperio usó a Compact para intimidar a la gente a apoyar a la realeza, y la mayoría de la gente veía a Compact como un grupo de furiosos jóvenes manifestantes.
#$ 3The Formation of the Solaris Alliance
3La Formación de la Alianza de Solaris
#$ 3As the New Empire grew in power, it formed a great fleet to conquer the rest of the former Ryuvian worlds. However, the now independent worlds grew weary of being ruled by another Emperor. The future hero of the Alliance, Madeline Gray, gathered ships across the independent worlds, and formed a mighty fleet to face the New Empire. As war was declared between the independent worlds and the New Empire, the forces under the command of Madeline Gray formed a grand military and economic alliance, dubbed the Solar Alliance, after the wealthiest of the independent worlds, Solaris. Under this agreement, all the worlds of the Alliance could elect a representative to the Congress of One Hundred, where political issues would be resolved through democracy, rather than tyranny.
3Mientras el Nuevo Imperio crecía en poder, formó una gran flota para conquistar el resto de los antiguos mundos Ryuvianos. Sin embargo, los ahora independientes mundos crecieron cansados de ser gobernados por otro Emperador. El futuro héroe de la Alianza, Madeline Grey, reunió naves a través de los mundos independientes, y formó una poderosa flota para enfrentarse al Nuevo Imperio. Cuando la guerra se declaró entre los mundos independientes y el Nuevo Imperio, las fuerzas bajo el mando de Madeline Grey formaron una gran alianza económica y militar, apodada la Alianza Solar, en honor al más rico de los mundos independientes, Solaris. Bajo este acuerdo, todos los mundos de la Alianza podrían elegir a un representante al Congreso de los Cien, donde asuntos políticos serían resueltos a través de la democracia, en lugar de la tiranía.
#$ 3The Alliance-Imperial War
3La Guerra Alianza-Imperial
#$ 3War raged between the Solar Alliance of democratic worlds, and the New Empire. Despite an early string of victories, the New Empire gradually began to be pushed out of Alliance space. The New Empire's fate was sealed when the Alliance formed a military alliance with Ryuvia, now reduced to just their capital world. The Alliance promised that various worlds now belonging to the New Empire, would be given to Ryuvia, if Ryuvia was to join forces with the Alliance. Now facing both the Alliance and Ryuvia, the New Empire sued for peace.
3La guerra se enfureció entre la Alianza Solar de mundos democráticos, y el Nuevo Imperio. A pesar de la temprana cadena de victorias, el Nuevo Imperio gradualmente comenzó a ser presionado fuera del espacio de la Alianza. El destino del Nuevo Imperio fue sellado cuando la Alianza formó una alianza militar con Ryuvia, ahora reducida a solo su mundo capital. La Alianza prometió que varios de los mundos que ahora pertenecían al Nuevo Imperio, serían dados a Ryuvia, si Ryuvia unía fuerzas con la Alianza. Ahora enfrentándose tanto a la Alianza como a Ryuvia, el Nuevo Imperio pedía la paz.
#$ 3The Treaty of Vespa
3El Tratado de Vespa
#$ 3The Treaty of Vespa formally ended the Alliance-Imperial War. The Solar Alliance betrayed the Ryuvians, refusing to return any of Ryuvia's former worlds. With the Solar Alliance now the galaxy's most powerful military and economic force, the Ryuvians had no way to retaliate against the Alliance. Instead, Ryuvia's former worlds, which neither joined the Solar Alliance, nor were a part of the New Empire, were now organized into the Neutral Rim Territories, a buffer zone which would separate the Solar Alliance and the New Empire. The New Empire was forbidden to ever enter the Neutral Rim to challenge the Solar Alliance ever again. The treaty ruled that the New Empire would remain in its territory, and the Solar Alliance would remain in its own, with a wall of neutral worlds, including Ryuvia, separating the two powers.
3El Tratado de Vespa terminó formalmente la Guerra Alianza-Imperial. La Alianza Solar traicionó a los Ryuvianos, negándose a regresar ninguno de los antiguos mundos de Ryuvia. Con la Alianza Solar ahora la fuerza militar y económica más poderosa de la galaxia, los Ryuvianos no tuvieron forma de vengarse de la Alianza. En cambio, los antiguos mundos de Ryuvia, que no se unieron a la Alianza Solar, ni fueron parte del Nuevo Imperio, estaban ahora organizados como los Territorios del Margen Neutral, una zona intermediaria que separaría a la Alianza Solar y al Nuevo Imperio. El Nuevo Imperio fue prohibido de entrar nunca más al Margen Neutral para retar a la Alianza Solar. El tratado establecía que el Nuevo Imperio permanecería en su territorio, y la Alianza Solar permanecería en el suyo propio, con un muro de mundos neutrales, incluyendo Ryuvia, separando ambos poderes.
#$ 3The Lessons of the Neutral Rim War
3Las Lecciones de la Guerra del Margen Neutral
#$ 3The Neutral Rim War was a bloody six-year long war between the People's Alliance (PACT) and the Solaris Alliance fought in the Neutral Rim Territories. The first full scale conflict between two military and economic powers since the Alliance-Imperial War, the Neutral Rim War saw the overthrow of previous battlefield doctrine.
3La Guerra del Margen Neutral fue una sangrienta guerra de seis años entre la Alianza de los Pueblos (PACT) y la Alianza de Solaris luchada en los Territorios del Margen Neutral. El primer conflicto a gran escala entre los dos poderes militares y económicos desde la Guerra Alianza-Imperial, la Guerra del Margen Neutral vio el derrumbe de la antigua doctrina del campo de batalla.
#$ 3Shield Generators and Laser Weapons
3Generadores de Escudos y Armas Láser
#$ 3The widespread availability of Anti-Laser Particle Emitters brought the declining relevance of traditional laser weaponry in large scale military operations. Whereas the Alliance-Imperial War saw battles fought across astronomical distances by laser wielding capital ships, the Neutral Rim War was defined by complicated dances with combatants only a few kilometers apart relying upon ballistic weaponry.>>>>Large scale laser weapons, such as the Cera Prototype Carrier Sunrider's Vanguard Cannon, and the PACT Super Dreadnought Legion's main laser, saw better results. Post-Neutral Rim War starships have followed suit and focused their power onto a singular laser emitter, rather than quantity-over-quality laser banks. Shielding technology has improved to the point of damping even these powerful weapons, but the arms race between laser and shielding now has no clear winner.
3La generalizada disponibilidad de Emisores de Partículas Anti-Láser trajo la decayente relevancia del armamento tradicional láser en operaciones militares de gran escala. Mientras que la Guerra Alianza-Imperial vio batallas luchadas a distancias astronómicas con acorazados portando láseres, la Guerra del Margen Neutral fue definida como una complicada danza con combatientes a solo unos pocos kilómetros confiando en armamento balístico.>>>>Armas láser de gran escala, como el Cañón Vanguard del Carguero Prototipo de Cera Sunrider, y el láser principal del Super Acorazado del PACT Legion, vieron mejores resultados. Las naves estelares tras la Guerra del Margen Neutral han seguido la rima y concentrado su poder en un solo emisor láser, en lugar de bancos de láseres de cantidad-sobre-calidad. La tecnología de escudos ha mejorado hasta el pundo de mitigar estas poderosas armas, pero la carrera de armas entre el láser y el escudo ahora no tiene un ganador definido.
#$ 3Dominance of Ryders
3Dominación de los Ryders
#$ 3The use of fast Ryders to quickly deliver decisive tactical results proved decisive in the Neutral Rim War and naturally developed alongside the fast-paced battles of the Neutral Rim War. Throughout the conflict, Ryders became increasingly miniaturized as the galactic powers sought to pack in more ryders into carriers, which similarly became smaller and smaller in response to the new doctrine of knife fight range warfare. Post-Neutral Rim War Ryders generally have been standardized to less than 15 meters in height, approximately 3 meters shorter than when the war began.
3El uso de veloces Ryders para obtener decisivos resultados tácticos demostró ser decisivo en la Guerra del Margen Neutral y naturalmente se desarrolló junto a las rápidas batallas de la Guerra del Margen Neutral. Durante todo el conflicto, los Ryders se volvieron más miniaturizados a medida que los poderes galácticos buscaban almacenar más ryders dentro de cargueros, los cuales similarmente se volvieron más y más pequeños en respuesta a la nueva doctrina de guerra de rango corto. Los Ryders Post-Guerra del Margen Neutral generalmente han sido estandarizados a menos de 15 metros de altura, aproximadamente 3 metros más pequeños que cuando la guerra comenzó.
# 4High Roller
4High Roller
#$ 4The ascendance of the young Queen Asaga di Ryuvia to the throne of Ryuvia marked a drastic increase in the nation's military expenditure, which was oft criticized by the Council of Ministers, but widely supported by the people in light of the murder of King Jaylor and PACT's growing conquest of the Neutral Rim. Pivotal to Ryuvia Prime's military program was the cooperation of captured Prototype Lynn in adopting Prototype technology for human use.>>>>The High Roller fully utilizes stolen Prototype technology to accommodate Asaga's True Awakening and replaced the now obsolete Black Jack as the Queen's personal ryder. With stellar specs in every area, the High Roller, like the Black Jack, is a versatile space superiority ryder with no particular weaknesses. To cut through drastically more powerful shield generators of the Post-Neutral Rim War Era, the Black Jack's quad laser cannons have been upgraded into a single back mounted laser cannon. An additional tail arm installed behind the ryder allows the High Roller to triple wield its weapons. With dual auto-rifles, a convertible switch blade/pulse gun, a rear mounted laser cannon, and anti-ryder missiles, the High Roller is a flexible ryder which can quickly establish control over the battlefield.>>>>Despite its vast suite of weaponry, the High Roller has a lower tonnage compared to the Black Jack thanks to its miniaturization of all its systems, giving it exceptional maneuverability, as well as portability in smaller carrier craft.
La ascensión de la joven Reina Asaga di Ryuvia al trono de Ryuvia marcó un drástico aumento en los gastos militares de la nación, lo cual fue frecuentemente criticado por el Consejo de Ministros, pero ampliamente apoyado por el pueblo en vista del asesinato del Rey Jaylor y la creciente conquista del Margen Neutral por parte del PACT. Esencial para el programa militar de Ryuvia Prime fue la cooperación del capturado Prototipo Lynn al adoptar la tecnología Prototipo para el uso humano.>>>>El High Roller utiliza completamente tecnología Prototipo robada para adecuarse al Verdadero Despertar de Asaga y reemplazó al ahora obsoleto Black Jack como el ryder personal de la Reina. Con especificaciones estelares en cada área, el High Roller, al igual que el Black Jack, es un ryder con una versátil superioridad en el espacio sin ninguna debilidad en particular. Para atravesar los drásticamente más poderosos generadores de escudo de la Era Post-Guerra del Margen Neutral, los cañones láser cuádruples del Black Jack han sido mejorados en un solo cañón trasero láser montado. Un brazo adicional instalado detrás del ryder permite al High Roller utilizar sus tres armas. Con dos rifles automáticos, una hoja/cañón de pulso convertible, un cañón trasero láser montado, y misiles anti-ryder, el High Roller es un ryder flexible que puede tomar el control sobre el campo de batalla.>>>>A pesar de su vasto arsenal de armamento, el High Roller tiene un menor tonelaje comparado con el Black Jack gracias a la miniaturización de todos sus sistemas, dándole una maniobrabilidad excepcional, al igual que portabilidad en naves carguero más pequeñas.

# 4Length: 25 m>>Wingspan: 20 m>>Crew: 2 pilots, up to 18 passengers>>Weaponry: 1 Gauss Cannon, 2 missile pods, 2 door mounted gatling guns>>>>The now 40-year-old T-35 dropship is an atmospheric gunship/troop transport manufactured by the Solaris-based manufacturer Hathway-Morganthaw. In large part due to its inexpensive maintenance costs, the T-35 has proved popular with Neutral Rim buyers and is frequently used by local governments to thwart terrestrial piracy and other criminal elements. The T-35 is largely comprised of inexpensive and easily replaceable parts, making them ideal for small planetary governments on a budget. On the other hand, it has garnered an arguably sordid reputation in Solaris Space after countless despotic Neutral Worlds tyrants deployed T-35's to put down would-be liberation movements, with frequent collateral bloodshed. Despite these unfortunate incidents, Hathway-Morganthaw counters that the T-35 is a taxpayer-friendly law enforcement solution which a near perfect reliability record.>>>>Armed with an anti-material gauss cannon, twin missile pods, as well as two passenger-manned gatling guns, the T-35 is a match for most terrestrial armor and cuts through infantry with ease. Further, up to 80 tonnes of vehicular equipment or cargo can be strapped to the bottom of the ship for transport.>>>>The Alliance armed forces largely shunned the T-35 during the Neutral Rim War, due to its limited performance in vacuum, as well as its inability to escape a planet's gravity well. However, following the disastrous Battle of Tethra and the ensuing stress on the Alliance's war budget, the Alliance Fleet experimented with using the inexpensive T-35's as insertion dropships in space to ground assaults, to qualified success. Due to the T-35's limited mobility during atmospheric re-entry, as well as its inability to leave the planet after insertion, the T-35 has come to be known as the "One Way Ticket" in the Alliance Space Force.

#$ 3The Battle of Tethra (Part I)
3La Batalla de Tethra (Parte I)
#$ 3With all prospect of peace between PACT and the Solar Alliance shattered in the bloody Liberation Day Massacre, both the Emerald and Crimson Fleets rearmed for the second stage of the Neutral Rim War. For a moment, it seemed like PACT's fate was already sealed: After a string of defeats in the past year, it had nearly been pushed out of the Neutral Rim. Had it not been for the lucky destruction of the Alliance flagship in the Ceran Assault Carrier Sunrider's suicide attack, PACT would certainly have lost Cera to Solaris as well, and with it, the entire Neutral Rim.>>>>In a twist of fate, Captain Kayto Shields' last stand inadvertently allowed the Crimson Fleet to retain Cera and set in motion the path to its miraculous victory in the decisive battle of the Neutral Rim War: The Battle of Tethra. With the newly declared Veniczar Fontana's leadership still under question, he called back the exiled legend of the PACT Revolution, Emil Kuushana, and promoted her to the role of High Admiral. An unusual move, given his predecessor's revulsion at sharing power with anyone else, but one which would prove to cement Fontana's legitimacy.
3Con toda posibilidad de paz entre el PACT y la Alianza Solar hecha pedazos en la sangrienta Masacre del Día de Liberación, las Flotas Esmeralda y Carmesí se rearmaron para la segunda función de la Guerra del Margen Neutral. Por un momento, parecía que el destino del PACT ya estaba sellado: Tras una serie de derrotas en el último año, casi había sido expulsado fuera del Margen Neutral. De no haber sido por la afortunada destrucción de la nave insignea de la Alianza en el ataque suicida del Carguero de Asalto Cerano Sunrider, el PACT ciertamente habría perdido Cera ante Solaris también, y con ella, todo el Margen Neutral.>>>>En un giro del destino, la actuación final del Capitán Kayto Shields le permitió inadvertidamente a la Flota Carmesí retener Cera y poner en marcha el camino a su milagrosa victoria en la batalla decisiva de la Guerra del Margen Neutral: La Batalla de Tethra. Con el recientemente declarado liderazgo de Veniczar Fontana todavía en duda, él llamó de vuelta a la leyenda exiliada de la Revolución del PACT, Emil Kuushana, y la ascendió al cargo de Gran Almirante. Un movimiento inusual, dada la repugnancia de su predecesora de compartir el poder con cualquier otro, pero uno que terminaría cementando la legitimidad de Fontana.

3La Batalla de Tethra (Parte 2)
#$ 3Emil Kuushana, more commonly known as the Crimson Wolf, was a legendary commander and ryder pilot of the Revolution. Frequently outnumbered and outgunned by the Imperial Fleet, she delivered miracle after miracle. Her most renown accomplishment is her victory against the Imperial Sharr Vysse. Despite her long list of accomplishments, Kuushana has shunned all political positions, making her a hero of the people.>>>>She hatched a plan, wherein she hid her personal fleet behind Tethra's moon, whilst the Crimson Fleet remained moored at Cera. The Solar Alliance, overconfident due to its early victories, and seeking vengeance for the murder of Admiral Gray, believed Tethra to be unprotected and performed a multi-planetary warp deep into PACT space to strike. However, the Alliance Fleet found itself disorganized and demoralized without Admiral Gray's brand of prudence. As soon as the Alliance Fleet warped out at Tethra, Kuushana's Fleet emerged, and counter attacked the surprised Alliance Fleet. Kuushana's fast ships and lightning ryder tactics proved effective against the Alliance's slow and bulky ships and the Emerald Fleet had no choice but to retreat.
3Emil Kuushana, conocida más comúnmente como la Loba Carmesí, fue una legendaria comandante y piloto ryder de la Revolución. Frecuentemente superada en número y armas por la Flota Imperial, asestó milagro tras milagro. Su más reciente logro es su victoria contra la Sharr Imperial Vysse. A pesar de su larga lista de logros, Kuushana ha rehuído de todas las posiciones políticas, haciéndola un héroe del pueblo.>>>>Ella maquinó un plan, en el cual escondió su flota personal detrás de la luna de Tethra, mientras que la Flota Carmesí permanecía amarrada en Cera. La Alianza Solar, demasiado segura de sí misma debido a sus anteriores victorias, y buscando venganza por el asesinato del Almirante Grey, creyó que Tethra estaría desprotegida y realizó un salto multi-planetario en lo profundo del espacio del PACT para atacar. Sin embargo, la Flota de la Alianza se encontraba desorganizada y desmoralizada sin la prudencia del Almirante Grey. Tan pronto como la Flota de la Alianza saltó a Tethra, la Flota de Kuushana emergió, y contraatacó a la sorprendida Flota de la Alianza. Las veloces naves y las rápidas tácticas ryder de Kuushana demostraron ser efectivas contra las lentas y voluminosas naves de la Alianza y la Flota Esmeralda no tuvo más opción que retirarse.

#$ 3Far behind enemy lines, the retreating Emerald Fleet was slowly picked apart by PACT hit and run squads. By the time it returned to the Neutral Rim, what little remained of the once mighty Emerald Fleet was a demoralized and damaged shell of its former self. Suddenly finding itself outnumbered by the Crimson Fleet, the Solar Alliance fell back to Ongess to lick its wounds and rebuild. While crushed, the Emerald Fleet would bide for time and strike when the opportunity presented itself.>>>>However, that opportunity never came. If the Battle of Tethra was the Alliance's coffin, the Trial of Kryska Stares would become the final nail which sealed it shut.
3Lejos detrás de las líneas enemigas, la Flota Esmeralda que se retiraba fue lentamente desensamblada por los escuadrones relámpago del PACT. Para cuando regresó al Margen Neutral, lo poco que quedaba de la una vez poderosa Flota Esmeralda era una cáscara desmoralizada y dañada de su antiguo ser. Encontrándose de repente superada en número por la Flota Carmesí, la Alianza Solar se retiró a Ongess a lamerse sus heridas y reconstruirse. Aunque aplastada, la Flota Esmeralda soportaría el tiempo y atacaría cuando la oportunidad se presentase.>>>>Sin embargo, esa oportunidad nunca llegó. Si la Batalla de Tethra fue el ataúd de la Alianza, el Juicio de Kryska Stares se volvería el clavo final que lo sellaría.

Unfortunately, the Prototype murdered all of the scientists upon discovering that she was to be replaced with Alpha. Alpha disappeared during the destruction of Diode and reappeared following Alice's ascension as the Veniczar of PACT, herself now the leader of a vast army of cloned super humans called the Prototypes. Alice seemed to join forces with Alpha and gained control over the Prototypes, but in reality, Alice's plan was to use Alpha's Prototypes to destroy all of humanity as revenge for Arcadius' death during the Compact Revolution. Following the Liberation Day Massacre, Alpha's whereabouts are unknown.

# 3Throughout the Ryuvian Empire's existence, various power struggles occurred between families for ascendance onto the Imperial throne. One notable civil war was the one participated by Sharr Sola di Ryuvia.>>>>Prior to the civil war, the Ryuvian Empire, drunk with power, challenged a backwater civilization, the Farari, expecting an easy victory. However, the Farari proved to be shrewd on the battlefield. Rather than face a destructive war, the Ryuvians and Farari arranged a political marriage, wherein the two nations wed their Ryuvian son and Farari daughter, and their mixed offspring would rule the Holy Empire. The Farari Empress converted to the Church of Ryuvia and was baptized as a true Ryuvian. However, many in the Holy Empire still harbored suspicions that her loyalty was to the Farari rather than to Ryuvia. The Ryuvian Emperor and Farari Empress produced two sons, the First Prince, and the Second Prince, Rayvin di Ryuvia. However, the Ryuvian Emperor fathered a bastard son, Crow Harbor, with his previous Ryuvian betrothed, setting up a potential succession crisis between the Farari Faction and the Ryuvian Loyalists.

Captain Shields ordered a courageous charge on Cullen's command ships, causing Cullen's frigates to overshoot the Alliance ships, while the PACT cruisers struggled to get into range. "Veniczar Arcadius," who was in reality merely a Prototype agent, observed the battle from the Super Dreadnought Legion, too far away to help.>>>>Shields quickly destroyed PACT's carriers, which ruled out an invasion of Alliance space.

PACT's fate was sealed with the early arrival of the rest of the Emerald Fleet, under the command of Admiral Grey. With PACT's carriers destroyed and all hope of an invasion of Alliance space lost, the Prototypes ordered a retreat, reserving the bulk of the Crimson Fleet for a bitter and bloody war of attrition fought in the Neutral Rim Territories.

4Ryuvian "Lancer" Corvette
# 4A prototype ship created under the orders of Queen Asaga, the Lancer utilizes Prototype technology given to the Ryuvian military by the Prototype defector Lynn to bolster the Ryuvian Kingdom's now obsolete fleet. A diminutive ship with an incredible thrust to mass ratio, the Lancer is fast, maneuverable, and hard to hit. Armed with just a single experimental laser particle cannon, she can deal catastrophic damage to ships several times her tonnage, even with enemy shields deployed. In groups, the Lancer Corvette can easily melt capital ships and retreat as quickly as they appeared, making them ideal for hit and run attacks.>>>>However, a glaring design flaw in the prototype model is the complete lack of point defense cannons, making them helpless against enemy Ryders. The fact that such a powerful yet cripplingly flawed ship even made it into production is a symbol of Queen Asaga's leadership - impulsive, impatient, and bold.

# 4Ryder Launch Systems
4Ryder Launch Systems
# 4In the era of ryder dominated space combat, ship designers are confronted with the question: What is the best way to launch them from carriers? Two different philosophies have arisen to tackle this age-old question.>>>>Catapult Launch: Inspired by similar mechanisms used to launch atmospheric vessels, magnetic powered rail launchers remain a popular option for smaller carriers, where a small squadron of elite ryders is preferred. The catapult allows a carrier to rapidly inject ryders into tactical positions by throwing them into battle, adding the momentum from the launch to the ryder's own thrust. When against carriers with "drop and thrust" launch systems, this allows carriers equipped with catapult launchers to engage hostile ryders closer to the enemy carriers, and further away from themselves. The main advantage of the catapult launch system is that it affords commanders with better flexibility and maximizes the quick strike potential of powerful ryders. However, the drawbacks of that catapult launch system are that it drastically reduces the speed at which all the ryders of a carrier's compartment can be launched, as well as being expensive and cumbersome to integrate onto the ship.>>>>Drop and Thrust: In this system, a ryder is simply slowly dropped out of its hangar pod and the ryder uses its own thrust to intercept the enemy. This system is cheap and simple, allowing a single carrier to quickly launch countless ryders in a flash to overwhelm the enemy with sheer numbers. Whilst previously disregarded due to a culture of technological arrogance, where militaries installed the more advanced catapult system as a matter of national pride, the reality of the Neutral Rim War has increasingly seen the re-adoption of the simpler Drop and Thrust technique.

4Findings of the People's Armada, Re: Melee Combat
# 4Following the deployment of the M-300 Type A Ryder (referred as the "Elite" ryder model by rank-and-file pilots), the People's Armada introduced the Model 1 Beam Sword to our glorious officer corps. As part of Dear Leader Veniczar Fontana's Fleet Modernization Project, this study was commissioned by the Veniczar to analyze the role that the Model 1 Beam Sword played in the Neutral Rim War.>>>>After compiling extensive battle data, as well as reviewing over 5000 hours of nose camera footage, the People's Armanda has found that overall, the Model 1 Beam Sword accounted for approximately 0.00004 percent of the confirmed kills performed by the M-300 Type A Ryder. Missiles accounted for 63 percent of the kills while the stock M-1 Rifle accounted for the remaining 37 percent. Pilot interviews confirmed the Model 1 Beam Sword's lack of utilization, with virtually all interviewees seeing no strategic value in charging headlong into the paths of enemy ryders at speeds of over 100 km per second to intercept enemy ryders within the Beam Sword's 20-meter effective range when the far more practical M-1 Rifle was available.>>>>According to the Intel Office, the Solar Alliance currently has no active ryder model armed with any sort of melee weaponry.>>>>Then why did the People's Armada originally believe that melee weaponry was an integral part of a ryder's arsenal? The truth lies in the wretched lies of Imperialism. We the People's Armada largely inherited the New Empire's military equipment - an expediency which was necessary at the time - and with it, inherited the Empire's fascination with melee weaponry, which in turn, they inherited from the Imperialistic Holy Ryuvian Empire. Based on the facts gathered by this commission, the People's Armada concludes that melee weapons serve no credible tactical purpose and is merely a symbol of the Imperialistic past. Thus, we recommend that all existing melee equipment be phased out and replaced with heavier missile pods.>>>>Note by Icari: Peh! The real reason PACT pilots can't hit worth a damn is because most of them are farm boys drafted from backwater worlds with around two months of actual flight training. There's no way any of them have the nerves to get close enough to use a sword. In the hands of a skilled pilot and a ryder with the right specs, just one flyby with a sword will end a ryder. Think of that the next time your missile pods are dry and all your assault rounds are bouncing off the front plating of an enemy ryder!

First, Ongessite ore is mined from the crust, then transported to orbit, where it is refined in zero gravity into a liquid form. Ongessite ore is highly toxic to humans and inhalation of both its dust particles and refined vapor causes severe health problems, ranging from lung disease, to permanent dwarfism.

# 4Ideally, an orderly retreat would imply that all deployed ryders have docked with their motherships, fleet-wide rendezvous coordinates have been entered into the navi-computer, and the entire fleet, in perfect formation, warps out of battle to fight another day. However, the fast paced battles of the Neutral Rim War have turned such coordinated retreats into fantasy. In reality, crash warping is now considered best practice by veteran assault carrier captains, wherein all ryders are ordered to divert all power to engines and quickly latch onto the carrier's hull through any means necessary. Once all ryders are confirmed to be latched on, the carrier performs a brief three to ten second warp to quickly escape the battle, ferrying its ryders to safety inside its warp bubble. The crash warp's duration is randomly determined through quantum seeding, making the likelihood of enemy pursuit negligible. Once out of warp, the carrier then collects its ryders into its docks, before warping again to a safe harbor, where it rejoins its battle group.

Possessing terrible firepower, incredible armor, and capable of launching a swarm of ryders, the Legion stroked fear into the minds of every being in the Neutral Rim during the early years of the Neutral Rim War. Her sordid reputation was sealed when Cullen mercilessly used the Legion to reduce Cera City into a smoldering crater in one of the most shocking massacres of the war.>>>>Much of the Legion's true history has been lost due to PACT propaganda. Some reports allege that Captain Kayto Shields successfully sunk the Legion in the Battle of Helion. Official PACT sources vehemently deny these reports as nothing more than Alliance propaganda. Other intelligence reports suggest that the Legion did indeed survive the battle.>>>>However, even in reports indicating the Legion's survival, she found herself more and more shunned by the PACT leadership upon the promotion of Admiral Kuushana. The bottom line was that the Legion was an aging warship from a different era of warfare. In the latter years of the Neutral Rim War, slow, cumbersome ships like the Legion no longer brought any real tactical benefit to the field of battle. In her twilight years, the Legion served as nothing more than a moving hotel for high ranked PACT officials, her tactical role replaced wholesale by the newer, sleeker, and cheaper Sagittarius-class.>>>>Finally, six years into the Neutral Rim War, Admiral Kuushana ordered the decommissioning of the Legion, citing spiraling costs to maintain an obsolete relic of the New Empire. Ceran Prime Minister candidate Miirage Foster delivered a solemn decommissioning ceremony at the rebuilt New Cera City, bringing hope that the scuttling of the terrible beast will bring peace to the millions of souls lost in the fires of the Neutral Rim War. In a twist of fate, the Legion's hull was largely recycled to build  housing for New Cera City, its sordid history becoming increasingly forgotten in the minds of Cerans - at least, according to the PACT media machine.

# 4With the average life expectancy of most Solar Alliance citizens hovering around 120 years, vast strides have been made in the field of medical technology, including the on-demand eradication all known viral and bacterial infections, as well as the regeneration of any part of the body and the lab growing of any internal organ, except for the brain. (Which is theoretically possible but universally outlawed following the discovery of the Prototypes.) However, the limited availability of medical technology and expertise, as well as the associated costs of treatment, continue to be the primary factor in ensuring that people in large parts of the galaxy still suffer from common day illnesses and die of injuries and disease.>>>>The Maray's sickbay is equipped with basic facilities to treat the vast majority of sicknesses as well as injuries. Equipped with a medi-gel generator, the sickbay can self-create medical nano-machines which are essential to the field of combat medicine.>>>>These nano-machines can quickly treat minor to substantial internal injuries resulting from combat. A full submersion bath in medi-gel can further rapidly regenerate body parts, such as arms, hands, and legs. Complicated body parts such as eyes, the heart, and the lungs can take longer to regenerate - however, cybernetic implants are also readily available for use in the meantime, ensuring that injured members of the crew can quickly return to their duties in most circumstances.>>>>In some circumstances, some injured veterans opt to keep their implants, finding them to be superior to their organic counterparts. Others opt for full restoration of their original body.
4With the average life expectancy of most Solar Alliance citizens hovering around 120 years, vast strides have been made in the field of medical technology, including the on-demand eradication all known viral and bacterial infections, as well as the regeneration of any part of the body and the lab growing of any internal organ, except for the brain. (Which is theoretically possible but universally outlawed following the discovery of the Prototypes.) However, the limited availability of medical technology and expertise, as well as the associated costs of treatment, continue to be the primary factor in ensuring that people in large parts of the galaxy still suffer from common day illnesses and die of injuries and disease.>>>>The Maray's sickbay is equipped with basic facilities to treat the vast majority of sicknesses as well as injuries. Equipped with a medi-gel generator, the sickbay can self-create medical nano-machines which are essential to the field of combat medicine.>>>>These nano-machines can quickly treat minor to substantial internal injuries resulting from combat. A full submersion bath in medi-gel can further rapidly regenerate body parts, such as arms, hands, and legs. Complicated body parts such as eyes, the heart, and the lungs can take longer to regenerate - however, cybernetic implants are also readily available for use in the meantime, ensuring that injured members of the crew can quickly return to their duties in most circumstances.>>>>In some circumstances, some injured veterans opt to keep their implants, finding them to be superior to their organic counterparts.
