Following the Paladin Incident, I was assigned to investigate the Iron Brotherhood criminal syndicate. My investigation has led me to the location of their kingpin. However, I am embarrassed to admit that I find myself outgunned against these scum. I know together, we will be able to topple this criminal enterprise for good.
